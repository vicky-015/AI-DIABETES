# AI-DIABETES

OVERVIEW
This repository contains the implementation of an AI-based diabetes prediction system using logistic regression. Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. In this case, the outcome is the prediction of whether a person has diabetes or not based on certain input features.

FEATURES
Logistic Regression Model: Utilizes the logistic regression algorithm to predict the probability of a person having diabetes.
Dataset: The system uses a specific dataset containing relevant features like glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, etc.
        Dataset Link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set
Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, feature scaling, and handling missing values for accurate predictions.
Evaluation Metrics: Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the model's effectiveness.

PREREQUISITIES
Python 3.x
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn
